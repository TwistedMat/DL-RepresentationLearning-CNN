# Deep Learning for Representation Learning
Using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform Representation Learning on classic Fashion MNIST dataset.

Additionally performing comparision with k-NN and Random Forest Classifiers using ROC curves. 
Using ROC curves to understand tradeoffs for companies based on their thresolds for FPRs and TPRs.
